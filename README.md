`envrun` is a CLI tool that runs a command with dynamically-sourced env variables.

When working on software projects it is often difficult to manage application secrets in a sane way.
We're dealing with more API keys and certificates than ever!

Sure, there are solutions out there. Some of them even work just fine!

So... why a new tool? I wanted something that would fit into many different workflows.
When locally running commands that need to have access to secrets, managing deployments with multiple differing sets
of variables, injecting secrets into config files,...

In `envrun` a variable can be sourced from a file, output of an arbitrary coommand, from the environment, or from any [compatible backend](#backends).

This tool is still under heavy development and its API might change at any time. Use with caution.


## Installation
To install using pip, run:

    pip install envrun

Other installation options are not yet available.


## Usage

    Usage: envrun [OPTIONS] COMMAND...

    Execute COMMAND with env variables from .envrun

    If COMMAND uses flags, prepend it with " -- ".

    Options:
    --non-interactive  Don't prompt for missing variable values.
    --isolated         Don't pass the variables from the outer environment.
    --help             Show this message and exit.


For debugging, invoke the `env` command, which should be available on most Unix-like systems:

    envrun env

If invoking a COMMAND which uses flags, prepend it with " -- ":

    envrun -- ls -al

If wanting to execute multiple commands within the same environment, COMMAND can be passed as a quoted string:

    envrun "ls -a | sort"


### .envrun.toml file

Envrun starts searching for a .envrun.toml file in the current working directory, checking parent directories
if no .envrun.toml file is found.

Variables are namespaced using the following convention:

    vars.<backend>.<var_name> = <var>

The following lines are equivalent:

    vars.<backend>.<var_name> = { key="x }
    vars.<backend>.<var_name> = "x"

The "key" has a backend-specific meaning. Generally, it represents
the most commonly-used setting for a particular backend.

 See https://toml.io/ for file format specifics.


#### Example

    # Variable LS will be set to the output of `ls -al`
    vars.shell.LS = "ls -al"

    # MY_PATH will be set to the value of $PATH.
    vars.env.MY_PATH = "PATH"

    [vars.const]
        # Hardcoded vars can be placed here.
        ENV = "development"
        TWO = "2"

    [vars.file.SSH_PUBKEY]
        # SSH_PUBKEY will be set to the contents of id_rsa.pub.
        key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"


## Use cases
### 12-Factor apps
According to the [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology, app secrets should be configured from the environment.
`envrun` can neatly support this workflow by keeping the `.envrun.toml` config files in version control and sourcing the config values
from storage backends.

### Infrastructure as code
When running configuration managament and Infrastructure as Code tools, there is often a need to inject secrets into the tool.
Different tools have different ways of handling configuration and secret managament, and they can rarely work together.

Environment variables provide a common ground, as they are supported by the majority of popular tools.

This is where `envrun` comes into play - it provides a concise and extensible way of defining and passing the variables to tools like `terraform` and `ansible`.

### Generating config files
Combined with the excellent [envsubst](https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst), `envrun` can be used as a rudimentary templating engine.

    envrun envsubst < nginx.conf.tmpl > nginx.conf

This will generate `nginx.conf` from `nginx.conf.tmpl` and replace all strings like `$VAR` or `${VAR}` with their values - as provided by `envrun`.


## Backends<a name="backends"/>

### const
Used for setting static env variables.

    [vars.const]
    PATH = "/usr/bin"

### file
Used for setting a variable to contents of a file.

    [vars.const]
    PUBKEY = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"


### env
Generally useful only when used with `--isolated`. Used for passing or renaming specific env vars.

    [vars.env]
    RENAMED_PATH = "PATH"

### shell
Used for setting static env variables.

    [vars.shell]
    GIT_REF = "git show-ref | head -1"

### keyring
The keyring backend currently supports key stores implementing freedesktop.org secret service protocol;
most notably Gnome keyring and KSecretsService. MacOS and Windows is still a work in progress.

Additionally, from version 2.5 KeepassXC should also work on systems that are D-Bus enabled (Linux). See https://avaldes.co/2020/01/28/secret-service-keepassxc.html for details.


    [vars.keyring.MY_SECRET]
    key = "my-secret"
