# envrun

`envrun` is a CLI tool that runs a command with dynamically-sourced env variables.

Currently, only the `keyring` backend is implemented, which uses a libsecret-compatible service, eg. Gnome keyring.

Alternatively, a variable can be sourced from a file, output of an arbitrary coommand, of from the environment.

[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/envrun/)

This tool is still under heavy development and its API might change at any time. Use with caution.


## Installation
To install using pip, run:

    pip install envrun

Other installation options are not yet available.


## Usage

    envrun [OPTIONS] COMMAND...


To pass options to the invoked command, prepend the command with `--`

    envrun -- ls -hal


Passing a `-i / --interactive` flag will prompt for missing variable values.

    envrun -i ls

If supported by the storage backend, values provided will get stored automatically.


For debugging, invoke the `env` command, which should be available on most Unix-like systems:

    envrun env


### Example .envrun.toml file

    [vars]
    # Hardcoded vars can be placed here.
    env = "development"

    [vars.MY_PATH]
    # MY_PATH will be set to the value of $PATH.
    type = "env"
    key = "PATH"


    [vars.KEYRING_VAR]
    # KEYRING_VAR will be set from Gnome keyring.
    type = "keyring"

    [vars.PWD]
    # PWD will be set to the output of the `pwd` command.
    type = "shell"
    command = "pwd"

    [vars.SSH_PUBKEY]
    # SSH_PUBKEY will be set to the contents of id_rsa.pub.
    type = "file"
    file = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"


## Use cases
### 12-Factor apps
According to the [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology, app secrets should be configured from the environment.
`envrun` can neatly support this workflow by keeping the `.envrun` config files in version control and sourcing the config values
from storage backends.

### Infrastructure as code
When running configuration managament and Infrastructure as Code tools, there is often a need to inject secrets into the tool.

`envrun` provides a concise way of defining and passing the variables to tools like `terraform` and `ansible`.

### Generating config files
Combined with the excelent [envsubst](https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst), `envrun` can be used as a rudimentary templating engine.

    envrun envsubst < nginx.conf.tmpl > nginx.conf

This will generate `nginx.conf` from `nginx.conf.tmpl` and replace all strings like `$VAR` or `${VAR}` with their values - as provided by `envrun`.
